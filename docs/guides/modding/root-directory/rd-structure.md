# Structure of the Root Folder

<!-- [++  ] -->
## ``/apps/``
The apps folder stores all apps you installed, each app is stored in its own subfolder. Apps come in two types: Lua and 
Python. 
Lua apps usually run a bit smoother and faster.

<!-- [++++] -->
## ``/cache/``
The cache folder stores temporary data generated by the game to improve loading times and avoid recalculating things 
repeatedly.
This includes: AI splines, Lua scripts, car data, track data, tree data, remote assets, … and more.

The game will recreate missing cache files when needed, so it’s safe to delete the folder if something breaks or if you 
want to refresh outdated 
data.

<!-- [++++] -->
## ``/cfg/``
The cfg folder stores various game settings in .ini files that get initialized on startup. Most of these settings are 
available through CM.

<!-- [+++ ] -->
## ``/content/``
The content folder contains all the assets and data. This includes: cars, tracks, fonts, driver models, SFX, and other 
resources the game 
needs to run. It’s basically where the main game content is stored and organized.

When you install new cars or tracks, their files are placed into subfolders here so the game can detect and load them 
properly.

<!-- [+++ ] -->
## ``/crash_logs/``
The crash_logs folder is intended for Steam AC. Content Manager has its own crash logs handler, so crash logs and reports 
get saved in your 
`C:\...\Documents\Assetto Corsa\logs` folder. This folder can usually be ignored.

<!-- [++  ] -->
<!-- ??Add WFX wiki page?? -->
## ``/extension/``
Everything CSP-related. Not a vanilla folder - if it exists, CSP was installed at least once.
Contains things like lua SDK, backgrounds, chaser cameras, config files, SFX, VAO patches, and WFX.

<!-- [++++] -->
## ``/launcher/``
Files needed for the original JavaScript launcher "AssettoCorsa.exe," from which "ACs.exe" is started.

<!-- [+++ ] -->
## ``/plugins/``
the only known plugin: ksEvotekMS.dll - no idea

<!-- [+   ] -->
## ``/sdk/``
modding tools

<!-- [++  ] -->
## ``/server/``
The server folder holds everything needed to run multiplayer servers: acServer.exe, acServerManager.exe, config files, track and car data, and logs.
It’s used when hosting your own server or uploading files to a rented one.

<!-- [++++] -->
## ``/system/``
VR/Python libraries for x86 and x64, plus other AC internal settings in ``system\cfg\`` and defaults ``data\surface.ini`` and similar.
