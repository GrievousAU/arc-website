# Root Folder

## How to Find your root folder

In Steam, go to your Library and then navigate to Assetto Corsa. Click on the settings cog, then go to **Manage > Browse local files**.

I recommend pinning the root folder to Quick Access, so you don’t have to repeat this every time you want to manually install a mod.

## Folder Descriptions

### `/apps/`
The apps folder contains all user apps. Lua apps are lightweight and generally faster than Python apps.

### `/cache/`
The cache folder stores temporary data generated by the game to improve loading times and avoid recalculating things
repeatedly.
This includes: AI splines, Lua scripts, car data, track data, tree data, remote assets, and more.

The game will recreate missing cache files when needed, so it’s safe to delete the folder if something breaks or if you
want to refresh outdated data.

### `/cfg/`
The cfg folder stores various game settings in `.ini` files, that get initialized on startup. Most of these settings are 
available through Content Manager.

### `/content/`
The content folder contains all cars, tracks, fonts, driver models, and other resources the game needs to run.
It’s basically where the main game content is stored and organized.

When installing new mods, their files are usually placed here in subfolders so they can be detected and loaded properly.

### `/crash_logs/`
The crash_logs folder is used when you launch the game through Steam only. Content Manager uses its own system, saving logs to `Documents/Assetto Corsa/logs` in your user folder.
This folder can be ignored.

### `/extension/`
Contains everything CSP-related. Not a vanilla folder — if it exists, CSP was installed at least once.
Includes things like the Lua SDK, backgrounds, chaser cameras, config files, SFX, VAO patches, and WFX.

### `/launcher/`
Files needed for the original JavaScript launcher, "AssettoCorsa.exe" from which "acs.exe" is started.

### `/sdk/`
The sdk folder contains tools and resources for modders, like the ksEditor used to create car and track mods.

### `/server/`
The server folder contains everything needed to run multiplayer servers: executables, config files, track and car data, and logs.
It’s used when hosting your own server.

### `/system/`
The system folder contains VR and Python libraries for x86 and x64, as well as other internal AC settings in `system/cfg` and default data like `data/surface.ini`.
