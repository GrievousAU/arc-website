# Look Up Tables (LUTs)
> <Badge type="tip" text="Updated"/>

A lookup table (LUT) is an array that replaces runtime computation of a mathematical function with a simpler array indexing operation, in a process termed as direct addressing. The savings in processing time can be significant, because retrieving a value from memory is often faster than carrying out an "expensive" computation or input/output operation.

### Photo LUTs
They can be used as a preset that adjusts the colors and tones of an image or video. Think of it as a filter that applies a specific color grading style to your footage or photos.

To find LUTs, simply search `color grading luts` and find ones that suit your desired look.

### Force Feedback LUTs
They can also be applied to Force Feedback using a LUT generator designed for wheelbases. They will send and measure specific forces to your wheel and record the response inside a Look Up Table which provides more accurate Force Feedback.
