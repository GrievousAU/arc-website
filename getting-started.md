# Getting Started

This guide outlines the recommended setup process for Assetto Corsa using tools the community relies on. Whether you're just starting out or setting up a fresh install, this will get you to a modern baseline.

## 1. Install Assetto Corsa

Assetto Corsa must be purchased and installed via **[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)**:

```txt
https://store.steampowered.com/app/244210/Assetto_Corsa/
```

We recommend buying the **Ultimate Edition Bundle**, which includes all official DLC. Many servers require at least some of these DLC's to work. The game is frequently on sale, so it's worth waiting for a discount if you're not in a rush.

After installation, launch the game once. It's not strictly required, but doing so ensures that all folders and config files are created. You can close the game after reaching the main menu.

## 2. Install Content Manager

<!-- TODO: ADD REFERENCES TO ILJA'S CREATOR PROFILE FOR THIS SECTION -->

Content Manager (CM) is a third-party launcher developed by **[Ilja Jusupov](creator-profile.md)**. It replaces the original Assetto Corsa launcher and is considered essential for anyone using mods or joining online servers.

**Download it from:**

```txt
https://acstuff.ru/app/
```

To install:

- Extract the archive
- Launch `ContentManager.exe`
- Set the path to the Assetto Corsa installation directory when prompted

## 3. Install Custom Shaders Patch (CSP)

Custom Shaders Patch (CSP) is an essential extension that adds advanced graphic rendering, lighting, physics interaction, weather support, and other under-the-hood improvements. It is developed by the same creator as Content Manager.

To install:

- Open Content Manager
- Navigate to `Settings -> Custom Shaders Patch`
- Select and install the latest **recommended** version

This will install the free version, which is enough for most users. To access experimental builds and extra features (such as rain), you'll need to support the project on Patreon:

## 4. Install Pure

<!-- TODO: ADD REFERENCES TO PETER'S CREATOR PROFILE FOR THIS SECTION -->

**Pure** is a comprehensive weather and lighting framework developed by **[Peter Boese](creator-profile.md)**. It replaces older systems like SOL, and is the current standard for enhanced visuals and weather control in Assetto Corsa.

Pure is only available through Boese's Patreon:

```txt
https://www.patreon.com/peterboese
```

To install:

- Download the archive
- Place the folders into the Assetto Corsa root directory
- Replace any old files when prompted

To make sure Pure has been installed correctly, go to `Content Manager -> Settings -> Custom Shaders Patch -> Extensions -> Weather FX` and make sure Pure appears under the `Weather style` dropdown.
