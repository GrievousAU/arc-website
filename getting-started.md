<!-- TODO: NEED TO CLARIFY THE WORDING AND WHAT NOT -->

# Getting Started

This section details the recommended setup for Assetto Corsa using standard tools essential for most mods and servers.

## 1. Install Assetto Corsa

Assetto Corsa must be purchased and installed via Steam:

```txt
https://store.steampowered.com/app/244210/Assetto_Corsa/
```

We suggest the **Ultimate Edition**, which includes all DLC's needed for modded cars, tracks, and online servers. The game often goes on sale so you can wait to get the game for cheaper.

After installation, launch the game once. This ensures that all necessary configuration files and directories are generated. You may close the game after reaching the main menu.

## 2. Install Content Manager

## 3. Install Custom Shaders Patch (CSP)

Custom Shaders Patch (CSP) is an extension that improves graphic rendering, lighting, physics interaction, weather support, and more. It is developed by the same creator as Content Manager.

To install:

- Open Content Manager
- Navigate to `Settings -> Custom Shaders Patch`
- Select and install the latest _recommended_ version

The free version is sufficient for standard use. The latest experimental features are available exclusively through Patreon support.
