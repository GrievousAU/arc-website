A Post-Processing Filter, or PPFilter, controls how Assetto Corsa looks â€” color grading, sharpness, bloom, and more.

PPFilters are selectable in Content Manager. Some are tuned for Pure or SOL and may not behave correctly outside those environments.

See our [Photo Mode Guide]({{ "/guides/photo-mode/" | relative_url }}).
