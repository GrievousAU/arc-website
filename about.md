**ARC** is a reference guide for modding in **Assetto Corsa**.

It exists to document how things work — from tools like Content Manager and Custom Shaders Patch to visual setups, guides, and general modding knowledge. It will expand over time to cover more topics and use cases.

There’s no single focus beyond being useful.

## Contributions

ARC is still early in development, with just a small team laying the groundwork. The plan is to grow slowly, based on initial plans for the site and what others might want to bring to it.

### Meet the Team

### Get Involved

ARC is open to contributions of all kinds.

You don’t need to write full tutorials or know web development — small improvements will go a long way:

- Writing or expanding guides
- Linking useful tools and sources
- Reviewing or fixing wording
- Reporting bugs or outdated info
- Suggesting better layouts or structure

If you’d like to help, you can open an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/creacher4/assetto-corsa-arc), or message me directly on Discord at `creacher04`.
